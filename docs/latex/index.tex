\item This code was basically written to practice \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{\texttt{ Make}} and \href{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile}{\texttt{ Makefile}}.
\item You can find the blogs related to this repository \href{https://hacksd.wordpress.com/2018/06/19/make/}{\texttt{ here}} and \href{https://hacksd.wordpress.com/2018/07/26/recursive-make/}{\texttt{ there}}(careful, they are in order). And I would actually recommend you to read these blogs before using this repo.
\item I am not writing what the code in this repo actually does because I want you to find it out. And don\textquotesingle{}t worry, it\textquotesingle{}s nothing dangerous.

\item \href{https://git-scm.com/}{\texttt{ Git}}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/}{\texttt{ G\+CC}}(or any of your favorite C compiler)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Since this uses G\+NU Make, its specifically made for systems running Linux and its various distros. The command to get these pre-\/requisites in your Linux distro is\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian and its derivatives
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily sudo apt install git build-\/essentail}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cent\+OS like systems (Haven\textquotesingle{}t really tested on it, but it should work)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily sudo yum install git gcc gcc-\/c++ make}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Getting the repo}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
Clone this repository using the command\+:

{\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/Sudhanshu-Dubey14/Make-Numbers.git}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Sudhanshu-\/\+Dubey14/\+Make-\/\+Numbers.\+git}}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Building with Make}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
After you have obtained the code, you just need to {\ttfamily cd} into it like\+:

{\ttfamily cd Make-\/\+Numbers} (If you used above command to clone the repo)

And after that, just run make like\+:

{\ttfamily make}

Simple right! That\textquotesingle{}s what\textquotesingle{}s make was made for in the first place. After this is completed, you will find two new files in the {\ttfamily build} directory\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily functions.\+out}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily numbers.\+out}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

You can just {\ttfamily cd} into {\ttfamily build} and the execute these files like\+:

{\ttfamily ./functions.out}

{\ttfamily ./numbers.out}

And thus find out what these files actually do!!!
